# Content Management System
Create a blog or web site without any coding, with all content stored in the database.

This content management system started as my university senior project. I returned to it and improved the code and processes a bit, but I haven't worked on it in ages. It's probably full of security holes and bad design choices, but it was the launchpad to my web development career and I enjoyed working on it.

TO DO: add .sql file to build the needed database tables
