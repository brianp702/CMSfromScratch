# Content Management System / Blog
Blog software comparable to WordPress or Blogger.

This started as my university senior project. I returned to it and improved the code and processes a bit, but I haven't worked on it in ages. It's probably full of security holes and bad design choices, but it was the launchpad to my web development career and I enjoyed working on it.

TO DO: 
* add .sql file for building the needed database tables
* move credentials to environment variables and exclude from version control
* convert SQL queries to use MySQLi or PDO_MySQL and parameterize all user input
* audit for security vulnerabilities
