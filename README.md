# CMSfromScratch
Create a blog or web site without any coding, with all content stored in the database.

This content management system started as my university senior project. As my skills improved in the corporate world, I improved the code and processes. It's very amatuerish and bare bones, I haven't worked on it in ages. It's probably full of security holes and bad design choices, but it was the launchpad to my web development career and I enjoyed working on it.
